###Introduction

Fitness trackers provide valuable insight into daily movement, but understanding weekly behavior patterns can be challenging. This project analyzes a publicly available Fitbit dataset to explore how user activity changes across different days of the week.
To explore these questions, I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

###Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains daily step counts from Fitbit users. Its structure makes it well‑suited for examining how activity levels shift across different days of the week.”
Before analyzing the data, I prepared the dataset by checking for quality issues and ensuring it was ready for exploration.

###Data Cleaning

I reviewed the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies. Once the data was validated and cleaned, it was ready for analysis.”
Once the dataset was cleaned and validated, I moved on to analyzing daily activity patterns.

###Analysis & Key Findings

I reviewed the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies. Once the data was validated and cleaned, it was ready for analysis.”
To better illustrate these patterns, I created several visualizations that highlight how activity levels changed across the week.

###Visualizations

I developed visualizations to illustrate how daily step counts varied across the week. These charts clearly highlighted the differences between high‑activity and low‑activity days.
These visual patterns helped reveal clear differences in activity levels across the week.

###Insights

These patterns suggest that users follow a weekly rhythm in their activity. Some days consistently show higher movement, while others tend to be lower, indicating opportunities to support users on less active days.
These insights point to a few opportunities for supporting users in building more consistent activity habits.

###Recommendations

These patterns indicate a clear weekly rhythm in user behavior. Certain days consistently show higher activity, while others reflect lower movement, highlighting opportunities to better support users on low‑activity days.
