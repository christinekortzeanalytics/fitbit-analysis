Google Data Analytics Capstone: Bellabeat Fitbit Case Study
This study analyzes publicly available Fitbit smart‑device data to identify insights Bellabeat can use to improve user engagement and inform marketing strategy. The project was completed in R using R Markdown, combining data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and descriptive statistics to explore user activity patterns.

Users rarely met the 10,000‑step daily goal, suggesting an opportunity for Bellabeat to support habit‑building and increase device engagement. Users were also more active on specific weekdays, highlighting opportunities for Bellabeat to time reminders, challenges, and marketing messages for maximum impact. Understanding these activity patterns can help Bellabeat design features that support consistent movement habits and strengthen long‑term device engagement.
